# Welcome to Leazy! 

Leazy is an app designed to simplify the management of student housing and facilitate seamless communication between landlords and tenants. It streamlines processes like creating maintenance requests and managing property-related tasks.

Tired of going to the laundry room only to find all the machines occupied? Leazy has you covered! The app includes a feature that allows tenants to show when they are using a laundry machine, helping everyone avoid wasted time.

For landlords, Leazy offers powerful tools to make property management more efficient. Landlords can easily create a residence profile, import apartment details via an `.xlsx` file, and effortlessly create, fill out, and update situation reports for tenantsâ€”directly from their phone. Tenants, on the other hand, can easily access their situation report and profile details through the settings screen.

With Leazy, you'll never miss an update from your landlord regarding housing-related issues. Thanks to the newsfeed feature, you'll always be up to date with the latest information about your residence and more with Leazy!
